\section{Convergence of vectors}

Essentially the only way in which we exploited, so far, the existenceof an inner
product in an inner product space was to introduce the notionof a normal
transformation together with certain i m p o r t a n tspecial cases of it. A
much more obvious circle of ideas is the study ofthe convergence problemst h a t
arise in an inner product space.

\section{Norm}
The metric properties of vectors have certain important implications for the
metric properties of linear transformations, which we now begin to study.
